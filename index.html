  <h1>WE ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE</h1>
  <h2>YET...</h2>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="hiwwa">Here is where we're at</h2>

<div class="graph">
  <p>Cool graph showing here </p>

<h2 class="heading2style">Nobody knows what sustainable fashion might look like</h2>
<div class="smallflex">
<h3 class="h31st">but... we want to be the first to find out</h3>

<p>We’ll continue to deliver innovative, concious and authentic fashion for you, at a price you can afford while constantly working in the background to always and forever decrease our carbon footprint, our water usage, increase our renewable energy percentage and investigate our supply chain deeper and deeper to provide more than just a fair working wage for our workers, but having a positive impact on their life in our own beautiful way. </p>

<h3 class="h32nd">and... Silfen believes in actions over words</h3>

<p>Above is our interactive roadmap of sustainabilty goals. There we’ll share with you our big wins, our setbacks, our needs, our small steps and our big steps. 
  As a tiny company, right now consisting of 8 employees, a lot of goals have to lay further down the line, where growth will allow us bigger seats at the table and we can change the world for the better. </p>

<h2>Steps we’ve taken so far</h2>

  <h3>Reducing water consumption</h3>
  <p>We try to minimize the water consumption in our production in an effort to decrease its negative impact on the environment and to ensure local access to clean water.<br> <br>

    All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our cotton, than conventional cotton products.<br> <br>
    
    In 2020 we introduced a new collection of bags made from a new material; rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the oceans or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the world.</p>

<h3>shipping</h3>
<p>We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on our planet. Because of this, we strive to choose environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as much as possible – by joining forces.
<br><br>
  We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of shipping, reducing polluting emissions.</p>

  <h3>Working conditions </h3>
  <p>At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to put their children in school.
<br><br>
    Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement.
    <br><br>
    We support the different religions of employees and protect their right to engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from prejudice and injustice at the workplace.
    <br><br>
    We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is always crafted in a responsible manner.
    <br><br>
    All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified.</p>
