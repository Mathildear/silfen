        <p>
          We’ll continue to deliver innovative, concious and authentic fashion
          for you, at a price you can afford while constantly working in the
          background to always and forever decrease our carbon footprint, our
          water usage, increase our renewable energy percentage and investigate
          our supply chain deeper and deeper to provide more than just a fair
          working wage for our workers, but having a positive impact on their
          life in our own beautiful way.

          share with you our big wins, our setbacks, our needs, our small steps
          and our big steps. As a tiny company, right now consisting of 8
          employees, a lot of goals have to lay further down the line, where
          growth will allow us bigger seats at the table and we can change the
          world for the better.

          <h3>Reducing water consumption</h3>
          <p>
            We try to minimize the water consumption in our production in an
            effort to decrease its negative impact on the environment and to
            ensure local access to clean water.<br />
            <br />

            All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from
            eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less
            consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our
            cotton, than conventional cotton products.<br />
            <br />

            In 2020 we introduced a new collection of bags made from a new
            material; rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled
            material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
            oceans or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the
            world.

          <h3>shipping</h3>
          <p>
            We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on
            our planet. Because of this, we strive to choose
            environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in
            close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as
            much as possible – by joining forces. <br /><br />
            We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or
            train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of
            shipping, reducing polluting emissions.

          <h3>Working conditions</h3>
          <p>
            At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning
            obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but
            also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that
            it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct
            within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the
            ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our
            suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage
            our factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to
            put their children in school. <br /><br />
            Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as
            well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all
            employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement.
            <br /><br />
            We support the different religions of employees and protect their
            right to engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn
            discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from
            prejudice and injustice at the workplace.
            <br /><br />
            We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the
            issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution
            etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is
            always crafted in a responsible manner.
            <br /><br />
            All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified.

          <h3>Cotton</h3>
          <img src="img/cotton.png" alt="Cotton" />
          <p>
            Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton – a fabric commonly
            known as polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from
            eco-friendly or organic cotton. Both materials require far less
            water consumption than conventional cotton products. Every nylon
            product is made from eco-friendly material, meaning that the journey
            from raw material to SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little as
            possible.

          <h3>Leather</h3>
          <img src="img/leather.png" alt="Leather" />
          <p>
            All leather goods are made from sustainable high-quality calf
            leather and is a bi product of the food industry, meaning that every
            part of the animal is utilized in various industries. We love colors
            and new trends, but we incorporate consciousness and quality in our
            design processes to retain timelessness in all products. All our
            components, zippers, thread, reinforcement, glue etc., are made from
            high-quality raw materials. We encourage our customers to take good
            care of their bag, prolonging the life of the product. By caring for
            your bag, you will be able to create more experiences with it – an
            important factor in creating a more sustainable, mindful business.

          <h3>Vegan</h3>
          <img class="leaf" src="img/leaf.png" alt="Vegan" />
          <p>
            In 2019, we presented our first vegan option in a collection, and we
            have continued to this since then. We make sure that all non-leather
            material – e.g. our nylon, lacquer – are all 100% vegan, promising
            that these products do not contain any parts from animals.

          <img src="img/rpetline.png" alt="rpetLine" />
          <p>
            In 2020 we are expecting to launch a new collection manufactured in
            rPET, recycled polyethylene terephthalate. The material is well
            known as it is made from water bottles across the world – bottles
            that often end up discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled
            material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
            oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the
            world. With this new collection, we aim to emphasize the impact of
            pollution irresponsible wasting. We wish to pass this awareness to
            our customers, and to encourage them to help clean our oceans!
