<div class="smallflex">
<h3 class="h31st">but... we want to be the first to find out</h3>

<p>We’ll continue to deliver innovative, concious and authentic fashion for you, at a price you can afford while constantly working in the background to always and forever decrease our carbon footprint, our water usage, increase our renewable energy percentage and investigate our supply chain deeper and deeper to provide more than just a fair working wage for our workers, but having a positive impact on their life in our own beautiful way. </p>

<h3 class="h32nd">and... Silfen believes in actions over words</h3>

<p>Above is our interactive roadmap of sustainabilty goals. There we’ll share with you our big wins, our setbacks, our needs, our small steps and our big steps. 
  As a tiny company, right now consisting of 8 employees, a lot of goals have to lay further down the line, where growth will allow us bigger seats at the table and we can change the world for the better. </p>
