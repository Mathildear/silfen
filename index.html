        <h3 class="h31st">but... we want to be the first to find out</h3>

        <p>
          We’ll continue to deliver innovative, concious and authentic fashion
          for you, at a price you can afford while constantly working in the
          background to always and forever decrease our carbon footprint, our
          water usage, increase our renewable energy percentage and investigate
          our supply chain deeper and deeper to provide more than just a fair
          working wage for our workers, but having a positive impact on their
          life in our own beautiful way.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h32nd">and... Silfen believes in actions over words</h3>

        <p>
          Above is our interactive roadmap of sustainabilty goals. There we’ll
          share with you our big wins, our setbacks, our needs, our small steps
          and our big steps. As a tiny company, right now consisting of 8
          employees, a lot of goals lay further down the line, where growth will
          allow us bigger seats at the table and we can change the world for the
          better.

          <h3>Reducing water consumption</h3>
          <p>
            We try to minimize the water consumption in our production in an
            effort to decrease its negative impact on the environment and to
            ensure local access to clean water.
            <br /><br />

            Currently we use 50% organic cotton from our which uses 91% less
            water than conventionally grown cotton. This significantly increase
            the cost of manufacturer but we it’s worth paying for.
            <br /><br />
            With economies of scale there is a chance in the future we can
            negotiate a more viable price for this material. Then we can
            increase the percentage we use without dramatically passing on the
            cost to you guys.

          <h3>shipping</h3>
          <p>
            Shipping is a huge contributor to global emission and pollution. In
            the future we plan to bring production closer to home in EU which
            will dramatically reduce our footprint.
            <br /><br />
            Until then we plan to ship entirely by land as opposed to air or sea
            which is much cleaner and more efficient.
            <br /><br />
            However due to very sad political situations in both Afghanistan and
            Ukraine this is next to impossible at the moment.
            <br /><br />Returning to land shipping is a top priority for us.
          </p>

          <h3>Working conditions</h3>
          <p>
            Aspiring to sustainability goes beyond materials. Our supply chain
            involves many people in countries far away, and we must work to make
            sure than their standard of living and opportunities are fair.
            <br /><br />
            All the workers at all of our factories have pensions to guarantee
            them financial stability in later life.
            <br /><br />
            We also provide insurance for all workers and their families.
            <br /><br />
            We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure they follow the
            principles regarding working conditions, anti discrimination
            policies and quality control etc.
            <br /><br />
            All our manufacturers are sa8000 certified.
            <br /><br />
            Despite all this the regulations will be easier to enforcer and
            improve upon when this happens in Europe, so we’re also endevouring
            to move production here as soon as possible.

          <h3>Cotton</h3>
          <img src="img/cotton.png" alt="Cotton" />
          <p>
            In addition to being one of the most widely grown crops in the
            world, growing conventional cotton is also one of the most
            chemical-­intensive. These chemicals have tremendous impact on the
            earth’s air, water, soil, and the health of people in cotton-growing
            areas. They are among the most toxic chemicals as classified by the
            Environmental Protection Agency.

        <div>
          <h3>Leather</h3>
          <img src="img/leather.png" alt="Leather" />
          <p>
            Leather will never be an animal-friendly product: It is made of dead
            animal skin. However, the skin used to make leather comes from
            animals raised for their meat. In that sense, it uses a byproduct
            from another industry, so it doesn't actually need additional land
            and resources.

          <h3>Vegan</h3>
          <img class="leaf" src="img/leaf.png" alt="Vegan" />
          <p>
            Most people are unaware of how many animal products are used in
            clothing. From Animal based glue, feathers, wool, silk, and various
            lacquers.

        <div>
          <h3>Rpet Line</h3>
          <img src="img/rpetline.png" alt="rpetLine" />
          <p>
            RPET is the short name often used for recycled polyethylene
            tetraphyte (PET). It is the world’s fourth most common plastic
            resin, used in everything from food packaging to clothing. When you
            see the word ‘RPET’ it simply means that the PET in the product
            you’re looking at, should come from a recycled, pre-existing source.
