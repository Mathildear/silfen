      <p>
        We’ll continue to deliver innovative, concious and authentic fashion for
        you, at a price you can afford while constantly working in the
        background to always and forever decrease our carbon footprint, our
        water usage, increase our renewable energy percentage and investigate
        our supply chain deeper and deeper to provide more than just a fair
        working wage for our workers, but having a positive impact on their life
        in our own beautiful way.

        Above is our interactive roadmap of sustainabilty goals. There we’ll
        share with you our big wins, our setbacks, our needs, our small steps
        and our big steps. As a tiny company, right now consisting of 8
        employees, a lot of goals have to lay further down the line, where
        growth will allow us bigger seats at the table and we can change the
        world for the better.

    <h2>Steps we’ve taken so far</h2>

        <h3>Reducing water consumption</h3>
        <p>
          We try to minimize the water consumption in our production in an
          effort to decrease its negative impact on the environment and to
          ensure local access to clean water.<br />
          <br />

          All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from
          eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less
          consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our
          cotton, than conventional cotton products.<br />
          <br />

          In 2020 we introduced a new collection of bags made from a new
          material; rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled
          material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
          oceans or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the
          world.

        <h3>shipping</h3>
        <p>
          We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on
          our planet. Because of this, we strive to choose
          environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in
          close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as
          much as possible – by joining forces. <br /><br />
          We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or
          train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of shipping,
          reducing polluting emissions.

        <h3>Working conditions</h3>
        <p>
          At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning
          obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but
          also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that
          it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct
          within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the
          ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our
          suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our
          factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to put
          their children in school. <br /><br />
          Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as
          well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all
          employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement.
          <br /><br />
          We support the different religions of employees and protect their
          right to engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn
          discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from
          prejudice and injustice at the workplace.
          <br /><br />
          We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the
          issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution
          etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is
          always crafted in a responsible manner.
          <br /><br />
          All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified.

        <h3>Cotton</h3>
        <img src="img/cotton.png" alt="Cotton" />
        <p>
          Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton – a fabric commonly known
          as polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from eco-friendly
          or organic cotton. Both materials require far less water consumption
          than conventional cotton products. Every nylon product is made from
          eco-friendly material, meaning that the journey from raw material to
          SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little as possible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Leather</h3>
        <img src="img/leather.png" alt="Leather" />
        <p>
          All leather goods are made from sustainable high-quality calf leather
          and is a bi product of the food industry, meaning that every part of
          the animal is utilized in various industries. We love colors and new
          trends, but we incorporate consciousness and quality in our design
          processes to retain timelessness in all products. All our components,
          zippers, thread, reinforcement, glue etc., are made from high-quality
          raw materials. We encourage our customers to take good care of their
          bag, prolonging the life of the product. By caring for your bag, you
          will be able to create more experiences with it – an important factor
          in creating a more sustainable, mindful business.

      <div>
        <h3>Vegan</h3>
        <img class="leaf" src="img/leaf.png" alt="Vegan" />
        <p>
          In 2019, we presented our first vegan option in a collection, and we
          have continued to this since then. We make sure that all non-leather
          material – e.g. our nylon, lacquer – are all 100% vegan, promising
          that these products do not contain any parts from animals.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Rpet Line</h3>
        <img src="img/rpetline.png" alt="rpetLine" />
        <p>
          In 2020 we are expecting to launch a new collection manufactured in
          rPET, recycled polyethylene terephthalate. The material is well known
          as it is made from water bottles across the world – bottles that often
          end up discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled material is
          primarily made from plastic waste collected from the oceans, or from
          recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the world. With this
          new collection, we aim to emphasize the impact of pollution
          irresponsible wasting. We wish to pass this awareness to our
          customers, and to encourage them to help clean our oceans!
